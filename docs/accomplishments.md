## Star Paragraphs

- Tell me about a time you had to work on a team project to meet a deadline.

    - Situation: During a team project in the full stack web development program we built a web application using Node.js and express while following weekly Agile sprints and hitting deadlines.
    - Task: I was tasked with implementing backend routing and ensuring a proper database connection, while also coordinating with team members working on the front-end and the database.
    - Action: I followed RESTful structure when creating GET and POST requests. I also handled database connections using environment variables, while also regularly committing updates to GIT to avoid merge conflicts and keeping the codebase clean. I also updated team members during sprint meetings to keep deadlines in check.
    - Result: We successfully deployed a working web application on time, following good practices, and having only a few issues between team members.

- Tell me about a time you faced a challenge or setback that you overcame.
    
    - Situation: During a team Agile sprint in my BCIT full stack program, our group began to fall behind schedule because different parts of the application were being developed at different paces. When we attempted to integrate the front end, backend, and database, we encountered mismatches in data structure as well as several Git merge conflicts

    - Task: My responsibility was to help clean up the merge conflicts, and ensure the back-end was aligned with the front-end, so the team could get back on track.

    - Action: I started by pulling the latest changes and reviewing the merge conflicts to understand where the problems were coming from. I spoke with the front-end team members to confirm the problems we were having. We then resolved the conflicts, updated our RESTful routes, and tested everything to make sure everything worked. I also shared these updates during our sprint meetings so the team stayed aligned

    - Result: After these fixes, the application was smoothly integrated and the team was able to catch up to our estimated sprint timeline. We successfully hosted a working web application on time. This experience was vital to me, and helped reinforce the importance of Git fundamentals and communication in Agile team environments. I
