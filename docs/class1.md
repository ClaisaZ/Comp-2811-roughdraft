# Comms / UX / UI Design Redesign Project Week 1

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and redesigning an existing website using UX, and UI design principles. While documenting everything we have done and will do.

Our goal is to improve:
- Usability
- Accessibility
- Visual hierarchy
- Overall user experience
- Purpose of the website

---

## Website Options
We discussed the following website options for redesign:

- Magic Stronghold
- Craigslist Vancouver
- 4chan

---

## Chosen Website: **Magic Stronghold**

### Reason for Selection

Magic Stronghold was chosen because:

- The interface is outdated
- Navigation is unclear
- Visual hierarchy is weak
- UX principles are not well applied
- Secondary purpose of the website was not clear
- Chance to propose this new website in person

These issues made it an easy choice to redesign

---

## Problem Statement
The current Magic Stronghold website lacks modern UX/UI standards, which makes it difficult for users to:

- Find information quickly  
- Understand navigation structure  
- Trust the site visually  
- Understanding the main purpose of the website (selling or playing)

---

## Redesign Goals

- Simplify navigation
- Improve layout consistency (Design conventions)
- Enhance readability
- Apply UX heuristics
- Create a modern visual design

---

## Target Audience

Magic Stronghold is primarily used by customers interested in fantasy, gaming (Card games, board games), and community content ( TCG Tournaments).

---

## UX / UI Principles Applied
We considered the following principles:

- Consistency and standards
- Visibility of system status
- User control and freedom
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Accessibility considerations

---

## Tools Used
- Figma
- VS Code
- Markdown

---

## Conclusion
This redesign project aims to significantly improve user experience and communication through design, while following good UX and UI fundamentals.
