# Comms / UX / UI Design Redesign Project Week 2

This week was to explore the stages of UX methodology and discuss key usability factors that can influence design decisions. 

## Five stages of UX Methodlogy

UX methodology provides an understanding to the user and helps develop effective design strategies. Having a clear process helps developers create a more user-focused application.

The first stage is **Emphathize**, where we seek to understand users by identifying their needs, frustration, and goals. This is done through creating user stories, observations, and problem statements.

The next stage is **Define**, where we analyze the core problems we have discovered. This is done by having a problem statement focusing on the issues and solving it.

The next stage is **Ideate**, this stage focuses on brainstorming and creating as many possible solutions as possible. The goal here is to be creative and explore all possible approaches.

The next stage is **Prototype**, this is where we take the most promising solutions and we test them. This gives an idea to the team on how a solution might function in a live environment.

The last stage is **Test**, which involves releasing the prototype to users and getting feedback.

## 7 Usability Factors

The seven usability factors provides a checklist for evaluating how well a product or service meets a users needs. Together, this ensures that the design is practical and visually appealing.

- **Useful** — Is the product or service useful?
- **Usable** — Is the product or service easy to use?
- **Findable** — Can users easily locate what they need?
- **Credible** — Does the product inspire trust?
- **Desirable** — Is the product visually and emotionally appealing?
- **Accessible** — Can people of varying abilities use it?
- **Valuable** — Does it deliver value to users and the business?


## In-Class Real-World UX/UI Example: Ketchup Bottle Redesign

A strong example we disussed in class the the UX design of a traditional glass ketchup bottle. The older glass bottles were poorly designed because users often had difficulties getting the ketchup out of the bottle cleanly. This created a frustrating experience.

Over time, designers redesigned the product into a plastic squeeze bottle that also had the cap at the bottom. This redesign improved user experience greatly by allowing better control.

This example demonstrated to us how UX design can make a simple everyday product many times better.

## Applying the UX Methodology

After analyzing the ketchup bottle, the design process can be linked to the UX methodology:

Empathize — Users experienced frustration with glass bottles.

Define — The product was messy, inconsistent, and required effort.

Ideate — Designers explored new materials and dispensing options.

Prototype — The plastic squeeze bottle design was developed.

Test — Users quickly confirmed the new design was faster, cleaner, easier, and just better.

## Usability Factors

Useful — Dispenses ketchup efficiently.

Usable — Requires less effort and strength.

Findable — Opening cap is easy to locate.

Credible — Trusted and reliable function.

Desirable — More modern and convenient.

Accessible — Easier for children and users with limited strength.

Valuable — Reduces waste and improves satisfaction.

## UX in Everyday Products

UX design is not just limited to websites and applications, it also works for everyday products like ketchup bottles and remote controls. Well designed products feel intuitive and require little effort from users. In contrast, poorly designed products often cause frustration. 

## The Relationship Between UX/UI and Business Success

Effective UX/UI design has a direct impact on business performance. Products are designed well and easy to use have higher user satisfaction, which lead to higher user retention.

While poor UX/UI design can decrease revenue, lower user retention, and negative branding.
