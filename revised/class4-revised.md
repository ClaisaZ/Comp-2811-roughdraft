# Comms / UX / UI Design Redesign Project - Week 4

This week focused on creating clear problem statements to guide the redesign process. We learned that creating effective problem statements requires us to understand the ideal users and clearly define the problem and the purpose of the redesign. We learned a structure approach called 5 W's which help ensure the problem is well scoped and actionable. We also discussed Information Architecture which focuses on organizing and categorizing items in the menu

## Problem Statement

A strong problem statement should include a concise paragraph describing the issue the redesigned website, product, or service aims to resolve.

## The 5 W's

- Who — Who is using the site?

- What — What is the site offering, and what should be the main focus?

- Where — Where will the experience occur (primarily online)?

- When — When will users need this solution (immediate vs. future use)?

- Why — Why is the redesign necessary?


## Feature List

The feature list defines the project scope and outlines what will be implemented in the website redesign. Having scope helps keep the project focused on user needs and business goals.

### Example Features

- Update branding (colors and typography)
- Redesign home page layout
- Improve navigation menu

## Ideation

This phase focuses on creating as many potential solutions as possible in a safe non-judgmental environment. A class activity we did to accomplish this was **Crazy 8's**. We were tasked with rapid fire wireframe sketching, where we only had 30 seconds to sketch certain interfaces. The goal was to encourage creative thinking.


## Information Architecture

Information architecture (IA) focuses on organizing and labeling content so users can easily find what they need.

IF is comprised of several interconnected systems

- Navigation design - Determines menu type, hierachy, and structure
    - Hierarchy
        - Deep - Few top-level links with many nested pages
        - Shallow - Mnay top-level links with many nested pages
    - Labeling - Defines the language style used in menus
    
- Content inventory - A complete list of site pages and content
- Sitemap - A visual represetation of site structure
- Wireframes - Simple layout sketches showing page structure

## Group Exercise

As a group, we practiced information architecture by categorizing the following items into approprite top-level menu headings:

- Accessibility
- Audition Info
- Contact Us
- Current Shows
- Donate
- Getting Here
- Join Our Team
- Musical Theatre Camp
- Our Story
- Past Shows
- Ticket Information
- Venue Information
- Visitor Questions (FAQ)
- Volunteering

This shows us that organizing information architecture is important to let the websites content become structured in a clear, logical, and user friendly way. This also correlates with the business perspective since effective IA can increase user retention, which can increase revenue.
