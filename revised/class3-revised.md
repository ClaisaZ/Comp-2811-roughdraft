# Comms / UX/UI Design Redesign Project — Week 3

This week we focused on applying user-centered design principles to the website redesign. The main purpose of this class was to design based on real user needs rather than relying on personal preferences or assumptions. The class also reinforced the ideas of strong UX principles, which reflect how a business can grow.

## Topics

- Personas
- User Scenarios
- User Stories
- UX Artifacts


## What we did

During class, the team created multiple personas to represent different types of users who might visit the website. Each persona included unique characteristics, behaviors, needs, goals, income, and pain points. Developing these personas helped provide a clear idea on who we should redesign the website for.

Using the personas, we then developed specific user stories for each, to better understand how different users might interact with the website. This process let us get a rough idea how real users could interact with the website and where we could redesign certain parts.
