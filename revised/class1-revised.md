# Comms / UX / UI Design Redesign Project - Week 1

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and redesigning an existing website using established UX and UX design principles while also documenting the full design process. The primary goal is to improve usability, accessiblity, visual hierarchy, and the overall user experience. This project aims to really clarify the core purpose of the selected website.

## Website Options 

Our team discussed multiple websties for redesign, including Craigslist, 4chan, and Magic Stronghold. After evaluating the pros and cons of each option, the group ultimately selected Magic Stronghold as the most suitable, for a meaningful redesign project.

## Chosen Website: Magic Stronghold

[Magic Stronghold](https://www.magicstronghold.com/) was selected because the current website shows several usability and design problems that go against core principles of UX and UI design. The interface appears visually outdated, navigation structure is not clear. In addition, the visual hierarchy is all over the place, key UX and UI design principles are not applied.

## Redesign Goals

The redeisgn will focus on simplifying navigation, improving layout consistency, enhancing overall readability, and visual hierarchy. Our team will also apply recognized UX heuristics and modern visual design practices to create a more intuitive and complete user experience.

## Target Audience

Magic Stronghold serves a targeted audience, this audience is interested in fantasy and gaming, including trading card games, board games, model kits, and card tournaments. The redesign will consider both new visitors and returning members.

## UX / UI Principles Applied 

The redesign process will use what we have learned so far in the program, including usability principles, consistency and standards, user control and freedom, aesthetic and minimalist design and accessibility.
